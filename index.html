    <h1>THE LORD IS GOOD</h1>
    <P>All the time</P>
    <h2>I SAY THE LORD IS GOOD</h2>
    <p>Again i say all the time</p>
    <p> <em><strong>This is the book of Psalms.</strong></em> The Lord is my shepherd, <strong>I shall not want.</strong> He maketh me to lie down in green pasture. He leaded me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the path of rigtheousness, for His name sake. Ye though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil. For thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou prepareth a table before me in the presence of my enemy, thou annointed my head with oil, my cup runneth over. Surely God's goodness and mercy shall follow me, all the days of my life, and i shall dwell in the house of the Lord, for ever and ever, Amen,</p>
